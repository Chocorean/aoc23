# Advent of Code 2023

This is going to be my diary for AoC23. Just venting, writing comments and whatnot. Cheers!

## Day 1

Note for tomorrow: even if I'm excited about it, maybe it would be best to be rested before playing.

Surprised by the difficulty of this year's first challenge, and a little bit afraid for the rest, not gonna lie.
This year I'll push myself to do every single puzzle, even if that means getting inspiration from others. I know I'm not the
best at identifying how to solve problems, and I don't want to pressure myself too much since I really want to do all days.

And I'm sick. So I'll go at my own pace, lurk around the subreddit if I need inspiration, and hopefully learn new tricks in Rust and have fun.

Also, I should have trusted myself and go for this kind of implementation straight away instead of toying with regexes again, because that was much easier than I thought.

## Day 2

Surprisingly easier than day 1, I finally used my beloved regexes. Looking at the leaderboard, I would be very curious to see how people send this in 90 seconds.

I'm glad I've started AoC this year already, because I've discovered non-capturing groups (`(?:)` pattern) in a failed attempt for day 1, and I've already used it for day 2. My only wish is I was faster than that (I took 25 mins), but that is still okay I guess.
